The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.
She sells seashells by the seashore.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
To be or not to be, that is the question.
All that glitters is not gold.
A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.
Better late than never.
Actions speak louder than words.
Practice makes perfect.
Every cloud has a silver lining.
